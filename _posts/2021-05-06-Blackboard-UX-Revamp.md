Problem: The biggest problem with Blackboard is how difficult it is to find important information. I feel like the app does a much better job at displaying information properly
and shows the most important information efficiently and conviniently. The desktop version however, does not do this at all. Blackboard is a website that is supposed to be used for education and should be displaying
things like grades, assignments, announcements, documents (These are the most important things). However, I feel that Blackboard as a website does a terrible job doing this. For example, one of the most important things
people want to see on Blackboard is grades. However it is incredibly hard to navigate toward them. In fact you can't even find it by clicking on the class (as this just shows announcements, a feature most teachers don't even use)
In order to find the grades you need to click on a tiny link in the left hand part of the screen which takes you to another screen that looks entirely different. The navigation menu has a ton of UI and UX mistakes. First off, there is an
incorrect usage of visual hierarchy. The largest text that you see is just a bunch of random numbers. Below it, you can see the classes in italics for some reason and there is also very little contrast between the background and the actual text.
And probably the biggest problem is the way these numbers are presented, they literally have no meaning (what do these numbers even mean? are they percentages?). A minor mistake a lack of hover effect or any indication that you can click on these things. So when you do
click on these classes, it does show you all the assignments and the points that you got on them, but it does not show you the grade. In other words, you have to manually calculate your grade which is a terrible UX decision when the entire point of your website
is to show grades.
