title: "Case 1: Blackboard Redesign"
layout: post
---

Background: I am currently a student enrolled in college. My university uses a website that was designed to help students check their grades, turn in and recieve assignments, and helps them contact and email teachers. However, I noticed that this website makes it very cumbersome to do these things. Something as simple as finding grades is impossible since the website does not actually show the letter grade you got and instead shows how many points you got (and it doesn't even show how many points there were in total)


Problem: The biggest problem with Blackboard is how difficult it is to find important information. Blackboard is a website that is supposed to be used for education and should be displaying things like grades, assignments, announcements, documents (These are the most important things). However, Blackboard as a website makes it difficult to do this. For example, one of the most important things
people want to see on Blackboard is grades. However it is incredibly hard to find them. In fact you can't even find it by clicking on the class (as this just shows announcements, a feature most teachers don't even use)
In order to find the grades you need to click on a tiny link in the left hand part of the screen which takes you to another screen that looks entirely different.

This navigation menu has some UI and UX mistakes. First off, there is an
incorrect usage of visual hierarchy. The largest text that you see is just a bunch of random numbers. Below it, you can see the classes in italics for some reason and there is also very little contrast between the background and the actual text.

The biggest problem is the way these numbers are presented. They don't have any meaning. A minor mistake a lack of hover effect or any indication that you can click on these things. This confuses the user and makes them wonder what these objects are. So when you do
click on these classes, it does show you all the assignments and the points that you got on them, but it does not show you the grade. In other words, you have to manually calculate your grade which is problematic since the majority of people would want to see their grades.

My solution: I want to make the most important information accessible to students. I feel that when students go onto this platform, they would want to see their grades. I want to make it a priority to show those first. I also think that I can make it easier for
students by giving them access to the assignments by viewing their grades. I also want to tweak the way the platform shows grades. I think the mobile version does a brilliant job at doing this by changing the color of the background of your grade (it gets closer to red if you have lower grades and green if you have better grades)
this is a concept known as nudge theory. A nudge is a way to "push" a student to do a specific action. As human beings we are taught that red is a sign of something bad or a sign of danger. Green is generally associated with safety and growth. By changing the color of the grades, we subconsciously encourage students to do better in school.
My process checklist
1. Make grades much easier to find
2. Make grades easily accessible (make it the first thing to appear when you click on a class
3. Make assignments easily accessible
4. Add visual hierarchy and fix basic UI mistakes
4.5. Make the course selection one screen and the grades the next screen
5. Encourage students to perform better in school (by using nudges)

Process: First off, I changed the background color of the next screen to white. I wanted to make this screen look more similar to the one before in order to avoid confusion. It also creates more contrast and makes everything i'm about to add much easier to see.

I also decided to make a view details button in order to for the user to be able to see what they are able to click
